    <h1>VINOD KUMAR REDDY NELLORE</h1>
    <h2>The Comedy of Errors</h2>
    <h3>Act 1, Scene 1: A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.</h3>
        <p><i>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants.</i></p>
    
    <h4>AEGEON</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall<br>
        And by the doom of death end woes and all.</p>
    <h4>DUKE SOLINUS</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;<br>
        I am not partial to infringe our laws:<br>
        The enmity and discord which of late<br>
        Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke<br>
        To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,<br>
        Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives<br>
        Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,<br>
        Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.<br>
        For, since the mortal and intestine jars<br>
        'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,<br>
        It hath in solemn synods been decreed<br>
        Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,<br>
        To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,<br>
        If any born at Ephesus be seen<br>
        At any Syracusian marts and fairs;<br>
        Again: if any Syracusian born<br>
        Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,<br>
        His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,<br>
        Unless a thousand marks be levied,<br>
        To quit the penalty and to ransom him.<br>
        Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,<br>
        Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;<br>
        Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</p>
        <h4>AEGEON</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,<br>
        My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</p>
        <h4>DUKE SOLINUS</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause<br>
        Why thou departed'st from thy native home<br>
        And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</p>
        <h4>AEGEON</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        A heavier task could not have been imposed<br>
        Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:<br>
        Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br>
        Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,<br>
        I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.<br>
        In Syracusa was I born, and wed<br>
        Unto a woman, happy but for me,<br>
        And by me, had not our hap been bad.<br>
        With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased<br>
        By prosperous voyages I often made<br>
        To Epidamnum; till my factor's death<br>
        And the great care of goods at random left<br>
        Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:<br>
        From whom my absence was not six months old<br>
        Before herself, almost at fainting under<br>
        The pleasing punishment that women bear,<br>
        Had made provision for her following me<br>
        And soon and safe arrived where I was.<br>
        There had she not been long, but she became<br>
        A joyful mother of two goodly sons;<br>
        And, which was strange, the one so like the other,<br>
        As could not be distinguish'd but by names.<br>
        That very hour, and in the self-same inn,<br>
        A meaner woman was delivered<br>
        Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:<br>
        Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--<br>
        I bought and brought up to attend my sons.<br>
        My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<br>
        Made daily motions for our home return:<br>
        Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,<br>
        We came aboard.<br>
        A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<br>
        Before the always wind-obeying deep<br>
        Gave any tragic instance of our harm:<br>
        But longer did we not retain much hope;<br>
        For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br>
        Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br>
        A doubtful warrant of immediate death;<br>
        Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<br>
        Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br>
        Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br>
        And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br>
        That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br>
        Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<br>
        And this it was, for other means was none:<br>
        The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br>
        And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:<br>
        My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>
        Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,<br>
        Such as seafaring men provide for storms;<br>
        To him one of the other twins was bound,<br>
        Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:<br>
        The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<br>
        Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,<br>
        Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;<br>
        And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>
        Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br>
        At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br>
        Dispersed those vapours that offended us;<br>
        And by the benefit of his wished light,<br>
        The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered<br>
        Two ships from far making amain to us,<br>
        Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:<br>
        But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!<br>
        Gather the sequel by that went before.</p>
        <h4>DUKE SOLINUS</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;<br>
        For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</p>
        <h4>AEGEON</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br>
        Worthily term'd them merciless to us!<br>
        For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br>
        We were encounterd by a mighty rock;<br>
        Which being violently borne upon,<br>
        Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br>
        So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br>
        Fortune had left to both of us alike<br>
        What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>
        Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened<br>
        With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,<br>
        Was carried with more speed before the wind;<br>
        And in our sight they three were taken up<br>
        By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br>
        At length, another ship had seized on us;<br>
        And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br>
        Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;<br>
        And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<br>
        Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br>
        And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br>
        Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;<br>
        That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,<br>
        To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</p>
        <h4>DUKE SOLINUS</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br>
        Do me the favour to dilate at full<br>
        What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</p>
        <h4>AEGEON</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br>
        At eighteen years became inquisitive<br>
        After his brother: and importuned me<br>
        That his attendant--so his case was like,<br>
        Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--<br>
        Might bear him company in the quest of him:<br>
        Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,<br>
        I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.<br>
        Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,<br>
        Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br>
        And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;<br>
        Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br>
        Or that or any place that harbours men.<br>
        But here must end the story of my life;<br>
        And happy were I in my timely death,<br>
        Could all my travels warrant me they live.</p>
        <h4>DUKE SOLINUS</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd<br>
        To bear the extremity of dire mishap!<br>
        Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br>
        Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br>
        Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br>
        My soul would sue as advocate for thee.<br>
        But, though thou art adjudged to the death<br>
        And passed sentence may not be recall'd<br>
        But to our honour's great disparagement,<br>
        Yet I will favour thee in what I can.<br>
        Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day<br>
        To seek thy life by beneficial help:<br>
        Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br>
        Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br>
        And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.<br>
        Gaoler, take him to thy custody.<br>
        Gaoler<br>
        I will, my lord.</p>
        <h4>AEGEON</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">
        Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
        But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</p>
